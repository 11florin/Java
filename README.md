# Java Procedural Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Java projects focused on procedural programming. All projects were created using Visual Studio Code on Windows as part of a learning process to practice core Java concepts.

# Java Procedural Programming Projects
Java 
Visual Studio Code

##  Included Projects

### 1. Boolean Comparisons
This project contains simple examples of boolean expressions and comparison operations. It's designed to help understand how logical operators and conditions work in Java.

**Key Concepts:**
Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
Primitive data types

### 2. IfElse
This project demonstrates the use of basic conditional branching using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

**Key Concepts:**
Conditional statements
Flow control based on boolean logic
Nested `if` structures

### 3. Dealership
A simple console-based program that simulates a car dealership interaction. The user is asked questions, and the program responds based on their input.

**Key Concepts:**
User input with `Scanner`
Conditional logic
Console interaction

### 4. Methods
Simple methods 

**Key Concetpts:**
User input with `Scanner`
Conditional logic
Console interaction

# ðŸ“˜ Beginning My Journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

This repository marks the beginning of my learning journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. After reaching an intermediate level of understanding in procedural programming, Iâ€™ve decided to take the next step and explore OOP concepts in greater depth.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Understand the fundamental principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Practise writing clean and modular Java code using OOP paradigms.
- Build small projects and examples to reinforce learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

This repository will be organised by topics and progress:
- `Basics/` â€“ Classes, objects, methods, and constructors.
- `Inheritance/` â€“ Understanding and implementing inheritance in Java.
- `Polymorphism/` â€“ Method overloading and overriding.
- `Abstraction/` â€“ Interfaces and abstract classes.
- `Projects/` â€“ Mini-projects to apply OOP principles.

## ðŸš€ Motivation

My aim is to become confident in building scalable and maintainable Java applications by mastering OOP. This repository will serve both as a learning tool and a record of progress.

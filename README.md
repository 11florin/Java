# ðŸ“˜ Beginning My Journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

This repository marks the beginning of my learning journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. After reaching an intermediate level of understanding in procedural programming, Iâ€™ve decided to take the next step and explore OOP concepts in greater depth.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Understand the fundamental principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Practise writing clean and modular Java code using OOP paradigms.
- Build small projects and examples to reinforce learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

This repository will be organised by topics and progress:
- `Basics/` â€“ Classes, objects, methods, and constructors.
- `Inheritance/` â€“ Understanding and implementing inheritance in Java.
- `Polymorphism/` â€“ Method overloading and overriding.
- `Abstraction/` â€“ Interfaces and abstract classes.
- `Projects/` â€“ Mini-projects to apply OOP principles.

## ðŸš€ Motivation

My aim is to become confident in building scalable and maintainable Java applications by mastering OOP. This repository will serve both as a learning tool and a record of progress.

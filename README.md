# Java Procedural Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Java projects focused on procedural programming. All projects were created using Visual Studio Code on Windows as part of a learning process to practice core Java concepts.

# Java Procedural Programming Projects
Java 
Visual Studio Code

##  Included Projects

### 1. Boolean Comparisons
This project contains simple examples of boolean expressions and comparison operations. It's designed to help understand how logical operators and conditions work in Java.

**Key Concepts:**
Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
Primitive data types

### 2. IfElse
This project demonstrates the use of basic conditional branching using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

**Key Concepts:**
Conditional statements
Flow control based on boolean logic
Nested `if` structures

### 3. Dealership
A simple console-based program that simulates a car dealership interaction. The user is asked questions, and the program responds based on their input.

**Key Concepts:**
User input with `Scanner`
Conditional logic
Console interaction

### 4. Methods
Simple methods 

**Key Concetpts:**
User input with `Scanner`
Conditional logic
Console interaction

# 📘 Beginning My Journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

This repository marks the beginning of my learning journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. After reaching an intermediate level of understanding in procedural programming, I’ve decided to take the next step and explore OOP concepts in greater depth.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand the fundamental principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Practise writing clean and modular Java code using OOP paradigms.
- Build small projects and examples to reinforce learning.

## 📂 Structure

This repository will be organised by topics and progress:
- `Basics/` – Classes, objects, methods, and constructors.
- `Inheritance/` – Understanding and implementing inheritance in Java.
- `Polymorphism/` – Method overloading and overriding.
- `Abstraction/` – Interfaces and abstract classes.
- `Projects/` – Mini-projects to apply OOP principles.

## 🚀 Motivation

My aim is to become confident in building scalable and maintainable Java applications by mastering OOP. This repository will serve both as a learning tool and a record of progress.

# 🎲 DiceJack

**DiceJack** is a simple console-based game written in Java, inspired by Blackjack but using dice instead of cards.

## 📜 How It Works

1. The computer rolls **three dice** secretly.
2. The player is asked to input **three numbers** between 1 and 6.
3. The sums of the player's numbers and the dice rolls are compared.
4. The player wins **if their total is higher than the computer's**, but **the difference must be less than 5** to keep things fair.

## 🧠 Game Logic

- If the player inputs a number outside the valid range (1–6), the game will end immediately.
- Winning condition:
  - Player's total must be **greater** than the dice total.
  - The **difference** between them must be **less than 5**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- No external libraries – pure standard input/output

## ▶️ How to Play

1. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac DiceJack.java
>>>>>>> Dice-Project-JAVA/main

#  Blackjack – Java Console Edition

A simplified, text-based Blackjack game built in Java. Test your luck and strategy against a computer dealer in this classic casino-style game — right in your terminal!

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 — without going over.

### 👇 Basic Rules

- You are dealt **2 random cards**.
- The dealer is also dealt **2 cards**: one face-up, one hidden.
- All numbered cards count as their value (2–10).
- Face cards (J, Q, K) count as **10**.
- Aces are currently treated as **1** (not 1 or 11).
- You can choose to:
  - **Hit**: draw another card
  - **Stay**: end your turn
- If your total exceeds 21, you **bust** and lose.
- The dealer then draws until their total is 17 or higher.
- The highest hand (<= 21) wins.

---

## 📦 Features

- Interactive command-line gameplay
- Random card draw logic
- ASCII art playing cards
- Input validation (e.g. only accepts `"hit"` or `"stay"`)
- Simple win/loss messages

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed (version 8 or higher).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder.
4. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   javac Blackjack.java
>>>>>>> Blackjack/main

# Rock Paper Scissors – Console Game in Java

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game **Rock, Paper, Scissors**, written in Java.

## How It Works

- The game prompts the user to type **"yes"** to begin.
- Once started, the user is asked to choose between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
- The computer randomly makes its own choice.
- The game then compares both choices and announces the result:
  - **You win!**
  - **You lose!**
  - **It’s a tie.**
- If the user's input is invalid, the game will display an error and exit.

## Features

- User-friendly text interface.
- Randomised computer choice.
- Input validation and simple result logic.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java** installed on your machine.
2. Compile the program using:

   ```bash
   javac RockPaperScissors.java
>>>>>>> Rock-Paper-Scissors/main

# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - Java Console Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe (X and O) game implemented in Java for the console.

## 📋 Description

This is a two-player turn-based game that runs in the terminal. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the board is full.

The program:
- Uses standard Java (`Scanner`) for user input
- Validates if a spot is already taken
- Checks for winning conditions: rows, columns, and diagonals
- Announces the winner as soon as one is detected

## 🛠️ Features

- Console-based user interface
- Win detection (row, column, diagonal)
- Input validation (prevents placing on occupied spots)
- Turn-based game logic

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or terminal with `javac`

### Running the Game

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/11florin/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-java
>>>>>>> Tic-Tac-Toe/main

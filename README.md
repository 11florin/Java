# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - Java Console Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe (X and O) game implemented in Java for the console.

## 📋 Description

This is a two-player turn-based game that runs in the terminal. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the board is full.

The program:
- Uses standard Java (`Scanner`) for user input
- Validates if a spot is already taken
- Checks for winning conditions: rows, columns, and diagonals
- Announces the winner as soon as one is detected

## 🛠️ Features

- Win detection (row, column, diagonal)
- Input validation (prevents placing on occupied spots)
- Turn-based game logic

Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
Primitive data types

### 2. IfElse
This project demonstrates the use of basic conditional branching using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

**Key Concepts:**
Conditional statements
Flow control based on boolean logic
Nested `if` structures

### 3. Dealership
A simple console-based program that simulates a car dealership interaction. The user is asked questions, and the program responds based on their input.

**Key Concepts:**
User input with `Scanner`
Conditional logic
Console interaction

### 4. Methods
Simple methods 

**Key Concetpts:**

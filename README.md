# Rock Paper Scissors – Console Game in Java

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game **Rock, Paper, Scissors**, written in Java.

## How It Works

- The game prompts the user to type **"yes"** to begin.
- Once started, the user is asked to choose between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
- The computer randomly makes its own choice.
- The game then compares both choices and announces the result:
  - **You win!**
  - **You lose!**
  - **It’s a tie.**
- If the user's input is invalid, the game will display an error and exit.

## Features

- User-friendly text interface.
- Randomised computer choice.
- Input validation and simple result logic.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java** installed on your machine.
2. Compile the program using:

   ```bash
   javac RockPaperScissors.java
